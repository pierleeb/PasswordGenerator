# Password Generator

A simple password generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
2. Click on the "Generate Password" button.
3. Your generated password will be displayed in the designated area.

## Customization

If you want to adjust the password length or the included characters, you can edit the `script.js` file and modify the `length` and `charset` variables as needed.

```javascript
const length = 12; // Change the password length as needed
const charset = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+";
```
